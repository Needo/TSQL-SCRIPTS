There are 3 types of temp tables in the SQL Server
1- Table variable declare with @Table

DECLARE @Products AS TABLE (ProductID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ProductName NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL)

This type of table is created in memory and visible only within the current batch. NOT VISIBLE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT BATCH SCOPE.
 
2- Temp table created with single # symbol.

CREATE #Products (ProductID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ProductName NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL)

It can be created using Create keywork like shown above OR it can be created using SELECT INTO syntax as following.

SELECT * INTO #Products FROM TableWithData --it crates a table on the fly and inserts the rows returned by select statement.

This type of table is created in the tempDB and visible/accessible only within current session that means, its visible across batches but not outside the current session.
In terms of SQL Server Management Studio every Query window is a new session. On session end automatically get dropped.

3- Temp table created with double ## symbol

CREATE ##Products (ProductID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ProductName NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL)

like #table its also created in the tempDB but its visibility/scope with global that means, it can be seen/accessed from other sessions like permanent tables. That means these
can be manipulated (insert, update, delete, drop) from any session. Like #2 these also automatically get dropped on session end that it was created from.
